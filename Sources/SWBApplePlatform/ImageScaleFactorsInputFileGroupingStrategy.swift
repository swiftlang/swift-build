// FIXME: Presently we have no good way during grouping to detect whether we're matching a single file against tiffutil or multiple files against tiffutil.  In principle we could handle that in FilesBasedBuildPhaseTaskProducer once all grouping is completed.  But at present this is handled in a hackier manner in TiffUtilToolSpec.constructTasks() - see the FIXME comment therein for more about this.
