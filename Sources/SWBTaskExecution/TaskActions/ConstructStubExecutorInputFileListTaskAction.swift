/// rdar://125894897 (ðŸš¨ fetchOperationServiceEndpoint seems completely broken for app extensions implemented in Swift (SwiftUI: Swift entry point data not found.))
///
/// We need to the final stub executor to contain the `__swift5_entry` trampoline to
/// jump to the debug dylib's `__swift5_entry` IFF it has one. Prior to addressing
/// the above, we always emitted the trampoline and assumed it would be inert unless
/// used. But for older delegate style extensions, the presence of this linker
/// section determines the launch lifecycle used.
///
/// To accommodate this at link time, we are choosing a variant of the stub executor
/// library, one with or without the entry point, based on whether the entry point
/// is present in the user's debug dylib. To do this, we need to inspect the binary
/// so we'll do this in a new task that will write the chosen library path to a file
/// list that is added to the stub executor link arguments.
