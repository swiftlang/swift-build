/// A threadsafe mapping of hashable keys to values.  Unlike a Dictionary, which has independent lookup and insertion operations, a registry has an atomic lookup-or-insert operation that takes a constructor block, which is called only if the key isn't already in the registry.  The block is guaranteed to be called only once, even if multiple threads lookup-or-insert the same key at the same time (this allows it to have side effects without needing additional checking).  Unlike a Cache, a Registry never discards entries based on memory pressure.  Unlike a LazyCache, the value creation block is provided for each call and not just once per instance.
// FIXME: We should consider whether we should combine Cache, LazyCache, and Registry, possibly with per-instance options for things like whether background deletion is allowed, whether a value creator block is guaranteed to run only once, etc.  At the moment, the various clients in Swift Build depend on the semantics of the various utility types they use.

    /// NOTE:  Currently there is only one lock for the whole registry.  If contention becomes a problem we could also have a separate lock for each value, and only hold the registry-wide lock while probing for (and potentially creating a slot for) the key.  The per-value lock would then be held while checking for (and potentially creating) the value.  This is possible because the key is known without invoking the creator block.
