/// Supports using an evicting base cache but temporarily preventing eviction during `cache.keepAlive { ... }`.
///
/// - It doesn't prevent the base cache from evicting, but instead temporarily uses an additional non-evicting store
/// - Only protects cache entries inserted or retrieved during `keepAlive`, not entries present when starting `keepAlive`
/// - Supports recursive and concurrent invocations of `keepAlive`, which effectively extend the lifetime of cache entries until the last active `keepAlive`
/// - After `keepAlive`, entries are removed from the non-evicting store on a background task which doesn't block cache clients
